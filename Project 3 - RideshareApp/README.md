## RideShare Ecosystem
RideShare is an internal ride sharing application for Revature associates. All associates can create an account on the first day of training with a temporary passcode generated by the app upon request of the trainer(a security measure to restrict non-employees from creating accounts). A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. Any associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have registered cars based on proximity and preference.
