### Project 0
This project is a console based bank with which a user can deposit and withdraw funds as well as manage accounts. It uses core Java and JDBC

### Project 1
This application is an employee reimbursement system. It is the first application in which we used both a front and back end. It uses core Java, servlets, JDBC and Angular

### Project 2
In this application we built an event registry application. Users of the app can register new events which are visible to Revature employees. It uses Spring MVC, Spring Data Jpa, and an Oracle11g database in the back end and as well as an Angular front end.

### Project 3
This was our capstone project, Rideforce the rideshare application. It allows Revature associates to connect with eachother in the effort to search for a ride to work. It uses a Microservice Architecture built using Spring Boot, Netflix Zuul and Netflix Eureka. We also implemented Netflix feign clients to communicate between the different business logic microservices. Each microservice has it's own tech stack.
